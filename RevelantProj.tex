{\bf 
Machine Learning, Virginia Tech}
\hfill 
{\it June 2020 - Current}
\begin{itemize}
    \item coded Perceptron algorithm and trained on test dataset
    \item implemented clustering algorithms (GMM, k-means) on test datasets (2D Gaussian Distributions)
\end{itemize}
{\bf Computational Modeling in Solid State Physics,
Virginia Tech}
\hfill 
{\it June - August 2019}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
Examined Bosonic quantum hall systems, and Anyonic dynamics.
    \item 
Developed C++ codes to represent quantum states for such systems, and composed matrix Hamiltonian for nearest neighbour hopping.
    \item 
Applied and tested exact diagonalization for that matrix Hamiltonian. 
\end{itemize}
